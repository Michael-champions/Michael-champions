- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michael-champions (Michael Attah Obi)

I'm a software developer.

I'm passionate about how technology boosts productivity and economic growth. I think is important to ask why and what we want to achieve before starting a project. I love how ideas come true by typing lines of code. I take a special liking to Python, C#, java and php and the cool things we can do with ML/DL recent developments.  

I love basketball, travel and excersing, and oh, i love food too. is there a better way to understand a culture than through its food, clothing and language ? I doubt.
- 👀 I’m interested in .... a lot especially software development and or anything ict, I'm in!.
I would love to travel to places like Verona, Paris, London, Berlin and of course United States.
